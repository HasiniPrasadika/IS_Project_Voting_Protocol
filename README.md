# Secure Voting Protocol for Class Elections

This project implements a secure electronic voting protocol using Java for a class election scenario. It emphasizes critical security requirements such as anonymity, vote integrity, confidentiality, and voter authentication.

## Features
- **Anonymity**: Ensures voter identities are not linked directly to their votes.
- **Integrity**: Votes cannot be modified or corrupted after submission.
- **Confidentiality**: Uses encryption to keep voter choices secret.
- **Authentication**: Prevents voters from voting more than once.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** programming language
- **AES encryption** (symmetric key cryptography)
- **RSA encryption and digital signatures** (asymmetric key cryptography)
- **Java Swing** for GUI interface
